Title: Low Friction

It's been a long time.

...again.

I thought that I had a pretty low-friction setup with my new blog on Octopress.
However, that was not the case. This morning I decided I needed to get my blog
back up. There have been a few times in the last couple of years that I wished
I had it available. However, I didn't have any of the dependencies set up on my
new laptop. So I set out to get ruby installed and ready to generate my blog
again.

After an hour of fighting `rbenv` and `bundle`, I decided it was finally time
to take the plunge, and switch to a Python-based tool.

I installed [Pelican](http://getpelican.com), and had it generating my new site
from the default skeleton in a few minutes. Granted, I've had to take some more
time choosing a theme and porting my content over. But grand total it's only
taken me an hour or two of tinkering, and should reduce my blogging friction
substantially, both on new machines and on existing setups.

I did port over most of the content from my old blog. I may delete some of it
going forward, mostly out of embarassment.

I lost my old disqus comments -- since there was only one comment on my old
blog, I decided it wasn't worth the potential hassle of making sure it
translated cleanly.

Additionally, the RSS feed is new, so you'll have to [resubscribe](/rss.xml).

So here we are, on the newest edition of
[blog.basepi.net](http://blog.basepi.net). Hope you like it.
