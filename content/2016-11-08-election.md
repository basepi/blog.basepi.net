Tonight I am embarrassed to be an American.

For much of my life I identified as a Republican. In the last few years I've
found myself identifying less and less with that party. Not to say I'm a
Democrat; both parties have serious problems.

This year I voted for Hillary. Not because she was the lesser of two evils.
She's far from perfect, and I don't agree with her on everything. But she's an
accomplished politician and a qualified presidential candidate. I like the
strength with which she has dealt with Trump's attacks. I voted for her because
I'm With Her.

This is probably not a popular opinion. But I'm trying to be true to my
opinions rather than just hiding behind the "Trump is a monster" argument.

Tonight America chose hate, mistrust, racism, misogyny, and violence. Tonight I
am embarrassed to be an American.
