Trump gave a surprisingly presidential victory speech:

> I mean, she fought very hard. Hillary has worked very long and very hard over
> a long period of time, and we owe her a major debt of gratitude for her service
> to our country.
>
> I mean that very sincerely. Now it is time for America to bind the wounds of
> division, have to get together. To all Republicans and Democrats and
> independents across this nation, I say it is time for us to come together as
> one united people.

Hopefully this is the Trump that will enter office as our next president.

Today I'm less worried about Trump as president than I am about the hate,
mistrust, racism, and sexism that his campaign made mainstream. He validated
[monstrous behaviors](https://twitter.com/i/moments/796417517157830656).

Read every story in that link. Think about what it would be like to live in
fear of the people around you.

As a straight white male, I'm blessed with safety from acts like this. I will
wield that safety in defense of those who are not. I won't allow casual or
joking racism. If I see someone being harassed, I will step in. I will serve
and love those around me. And I will pray for those who are living in fear
today.

Will you join me?
