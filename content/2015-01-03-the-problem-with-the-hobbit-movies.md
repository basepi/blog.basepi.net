I was catching up on my RSS feeds and I found [this review of the last Hobbit
movie by Ars Technica][1]. Sums up my feelings perfectly:

> There's one big thing that doomed these movies from the outsetâ€”the fiscally
> smart but artistically bankrupt decision to make a single, shortish
> children's novel into three feature-length prequel films.

Artistically bankrupt. Perfect way to put it.

> What these movies desperately need are boundaries, reasons to condense scenes
> or cut them out entirely instead of reasons to pile on more. Chopping these
> down into a pair of two-and-a-half hour movies would drastically improve the
> pacing even if you didn't address the characterization or the tone issues.
> You could leave around three hours of slow-motion action sequences, goblin
> chases, and Radagast the Brown on the cutting room floor! Sounds great,
> doesn't it?

Couldn't have said it better myself.
